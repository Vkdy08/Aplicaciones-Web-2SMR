        Rhodocollybia maculata, commonly known as the spotted toughshank, is a species of
        basidiomycete fungus in the family Omphalotaceae. R. maculata is a source of collybolide, a
        sesquiterpenoid containing a furyl--lactone motif reminiscent of salvinorin A.

        Description
    </h2>
        <p>
            The cap is up to 9 centimetres (3+1⁄2 in) wide and cream-colored with red-brown spots.[3] The
            edge remains inrolled for an extended period of time. The whitish gills are crowded, becoming
            spotted in age. The similarly colored stipe is up to 10 cm long, tough, hollow, and tapered
            downwards. The spore print is whitish to yellowish.
        </p>
        <p>
            A variety known as scorzonerea is characterized by yellowish color of its gills, and sometimes the
            stipe.

            It is widespread in <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Am%C3%A9rica_del_Norte">North America</a>. It
            often
            appears in decomposing conifer duff.

        <p>
            Though non-toxic, this species is considered inedible due to its toughness and unpalatability; it is
            typically bitter

            Kappa-opioid receptor agonism
            Main article: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collybolide">collybolide</a>
        </h5>
        <p>
            In 2016, Gupta et al. reported that collybolide exhibited high-potency, selective kappa-opioid
            receptor (KOR) agonism. Due to its attractive bioactivity and chemical similarity to salvinorin A,
            collybolide garnered attention in the synthetic chemistry and pharmacology fields as a potential
            scaffold for developing next-generation analgesics, antipruritics, and antidepressants.
            In 2022, Shevick et al. completed the first enantioselective total synthesis of collybolide and
            profiled the activity of synthetic collybolide at the KOR. Despite previous findings by Gupta et al.,
            these assays showed that neither enantiomer of collybolide had KOR activity. The synthetic
            sample was identical to natural collybolide isolated from R. maculata. Assays of crude R. maculata
            extracts by other groups additionally showed no KOR activity. These assays of synthetic and
            natural samples contradict the findings of Gupta et al., and suggest that collybolide and the other
            constituents of R. maculata have no activity at KOR.
